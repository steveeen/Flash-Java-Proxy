This is a small tool i use to check if my crossdomain.xml works fine.
It logs every Socket request and u can see what the Flashplayer wants, 
especially if you use XML Socketconnections.
It starts with a icon in the systray. 
In the dist folder is everything u need to use it, just click the jar File to start it.
Have fun with it.
